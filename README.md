# MC^2-Menstrual-Cycle-Companion


###The goal of this project is to dismantle obstacles and change access to menstrual health care, ultimately shattering long-standing taboos and enabling every community to lead healthier and happier lives.
How does this work?

By creating a user-friendly programme that helps rural women who are experiencing menstruation discomfort by educating them, offering emotional support, and making individualised treatment recommendations that include diet, yoga, and exercise. A user's conditions and symptoms are gathered using an interface made up of short questions and visuals that provide clarification, which is especially helpful for rural areas.

Steps required:
Data collection: Conducted by reading through numerous publications, papers, and blogs about menstruation health and obtaining particular photos and videos to keep the user interface (UI) straightforward and basic. This was then structured and stored in JSON format.

2. Building the application using Javascript and ReactJS.
